##Raw data collection
###Collection

Raw data are obtained from UCI Machine Learning repository. In particular we used the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set [1], that was used by the original collectors to conduct experiments exploiting Support Vector Machine (SVM) [2].

Activity Recognition (AR) aims to recognize the actions and goals of one or more agents from a series of observations on the agents' actions and the environmental conditions [3]. The collectors used a sensor based approach employing smartphones as sensing tools. Smartphones are an effective solution for AR, because they come with embedded built-in sensors such as microphones, dual cameras, accelerometers, gyroscopes, etc.

The data set was built from experiments carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, laying) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity were captured at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually [4].

The obtained data set has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.
